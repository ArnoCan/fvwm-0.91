This is release 0.82 of fvwm.

All of the features that I planned are in here, but some code
clean up still needs to be done.

Mainly, I would like to know if any features are useless, and bugs.
Other useful feedback might include comments about changes that would make 
the program better, nicer, or more useful.


INSTALLATION:
You will need to be root to install.

1. type "make install"
2. edit /usr/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc to change the last line from
   "twm" or "exec twm" to "exec fwm"
3. If you have your own private version of xinitrc in your home 
   directory, edit that too.
4. Probably should postpone editing /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/system.fvwmrc,
   the configuration file, for personal tailoring until you have tried 
   things out a bit.
5. Fire up X11, or quit, and re-start. You should see the 3-D window
   borders on your xterm's or rxvt's. Appearance is significantly
   different from twm if its working.
